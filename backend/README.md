# Backend

We want to store a wide range of assets inside a simple S3 bucket and corresponding SQL database.

This can make asset distribution and even implementing collaboration way easier, compared to having
everything stored locally or tracked in git. 

This backend should be easy to self-host and should use a simple docker container.
